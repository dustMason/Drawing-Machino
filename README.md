# The Hanging Hand

The `javascript` dir contains some experiments in creating artwork and resulting gcode
using both node.js and the browser. Some include a basic interactive UI which allows
manipulation of a scene before rendering out to SVG and gcode. They use paper.js and
three.js.

The `processing` dir is for processing.org experiments. These are more self-contained
and most of them produce PDF with vector art as well as gcode.
