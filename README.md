# The Hanging Hand

Based on the work of others, namely:

- https://github.com/MarginallyClever
- https://github.com/euphy

## Create

The `javascript` dir contains some experiments in creating artwork and resulting gcode
using both node.js and the browser. Some include a basic interactive UI which allows
manipulation of a scene before rendering out to SVG and gcode. They use paper.js and
three.js.

The `processing` dir is for processing.org experiments. These are more self-contained
and most of them produce PDF with vector art as well as gcode.

## Command

Right now I'm using MarginallyClever's gcode sender https://github.com/MarginallyClever/Makelangelo/tree/master/java/OSX but I plan to soon release my own, based on node.js.
